- First use fritzing to create the FILE.fzz file for the schematics
- Export from fritzing as a PNG file: FILE.png
- Open the FILE.png in Preview:
       - Crop it on the sides
       - Clean-up etc. (Fritzing tends to put some junk, patch it with white cut/paste)
       - Tools->Adjust Size: To width 600 pixels (height auto-adjusted). Size should be ~75K
- Save it!
