\section{Pass Structure}

  [node distance=.8cm,

     \node[passblock, join] (commproc) {Command/Procedure Translation Pass};

     \node[passblock, join] (repAbs) {Rep Abs\break Fussion Passe};
\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{verbatim}
condToDo 
commProcToDo
returnsToDo
[rules1Pass] ++ absLambdaToDo  
bindRetToDo ++ bindArgToDo ++ bindAppToDo
[rules1Pass] ++ absLambdaToDo
[rules0Pass] 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Conditionals Pass}

The conditionals pass transforms Haskell if-then-else expressions into the DSL's
embedded ifThenElseE construct.  It looks for two armed Case expressions with
arms of False and True, which return a type of Arduino a:  It performs the equivalent
of the following rule (which is not possible with Haskell rules, as the left side is not
a function application):

\begin{verbatim}
forall (b :: Bool) (t :: Arduino a) (e :: Arduino a)
  if b then t else e
    =
  abs_ <$> ifThenElseE (rep_ b) (rep_ <$> t) (rep_ <$> e)
\end{verbatim}

For the fmap application of rep to both the then and else expressions, it also
does the following transformation:

\begin{verbatim}
 forall (f :: Arduino a) (k :: a -> Arduino b).
     rep_ <$> (f >>=  k)
            =
    f >>= (rep_ <$> k )
\end{verbatim}

This ensures that the rep is TBD.
The Conditionals Pass is implemented in ShallowDeepPlugin/CondPass.hs.

\subsection{Command/Procedure Translation Pass}

The Command/Procedure Translation pass transforms all DSL command and procedures from their 
shallow form to their deep forms.

An example of a command transformation rule is shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
forall (p :: Word8) (b :: Bool).  
  digitalWrite p b  
    =  
  digitalWriteE (rep_ p) (rep_ b)  
\end{verbatim}

An example of a procedure transformation rule is shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
forall (p :: Word8).
  digitalRead p 
    =  
  abs_ <$> digitalReadE (rep_ p)
 \end{verbatim}

This pass was originally performed by GHC rules as shown above.  However,
this pass has now been automated, and only requires a table of shallow/deep
command and procedure pairs, and all instances of the shallow DSL elements
in the table are transformed to the deep element. An example of the table follows:

\begin{verbatim}
 xlatList = [ XlatEntry (thNameToId 'System.Hardware.Haskino.digitalRead)
                        (thNameToId 'System.Hardware.Haskino.digitalReadE)
            , XlatEntry (thNameToId 'System.Hardware.Haskino.digitalWrite)
                        (thNameToId 'System.Hardware.Haskino.digitalWriteE)
           ]
\end{verbatim}

The Commands/Procedures Transformation Pass is implemented in ShallowDeepPlugin/CommProcPass.hs.

\subsection{Return Function Translation Pass}

The Return Function Translation pass transforms DSL monadic returns through
the equivalent of the following rule:

\begin{verbatim}
  forall (x :: a => ExprB a)
    return a
      =
    abs_ <$> return (rep_ x)
\end{verbatim}

This transforms returns in the same way that DSL commands and procedures
were transformed by the Command/Procedure Transformation Pass.
The Returns Transformation Pass is implemented in ShallowDeepPlugin/ReturnsPass.hs.

\subsection{Rep Push and Abs Lambda Passes}

The Rep Push and Abs Lambda passes are used to manipulate the worker
wrapper functions which were inserted by the previous passes, transforming
shallow expression functions to deep, and moving the functions for
possible fusion in the last pass.

The Rep Push pass is currently performed by rules, and it phase it occurs in
is controlled by marking the rules with a [1].  An example of a rep push rule
is shown below.  One of these rules needs to be defined for each of the DSL's
Expr operations:

\begin{verbatim}
  forall (b1 :: Bool) (b2 :: Bool).
    rep_ (b1 || b2)
      =
    (rep_ b1) ||* (rep_ b2)
\end{verbatim}

The Rep Push pass is currently executed in the plugin by running the rules1Pass. 
An attempt to write this pass without rules has been made also, and is
located at ShallowDeepPlugin/RepPushPass.hs.  Like the CommProcPass,
it contains a table of the Expr operations for transformation.  (In the example 
rule about this pair consists of the Template Haskell names for the (||) and (||*)
operators.  However, this prototype pass does not work for all of the DSL 
operators, specifically those using Type Families, such as (>*) and (==*).
A solution will require generating Cast's and Coercion's, which is yet to
be investigated.

\begin{verbatim}
 forall (f :: Arduino a) (g :: a -> Arduino (Expr b)) (k :: b -> Arduino c).
     (f >>= (abs_ <$> g)) >>= k
            =
     (f >>= g) >>= k . abs_
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
 forall (f :: Arduino a).
     (\x -> F[x]).abs
        =
     (\x' -> let x=abs(x') in F[x])
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Local Functions (Binds) Passes}

\subsection{Rep Abs Fusion Pass}

This final pass fuses the rep and abs pairs that have been moved next
to each other by the other passes.  This is currently performed by
two rules and the phase they occur in are controlled by marking the rules
with a [0].  Two rules are required, one for direct application, and one for
fmap application.

\begin{verbatim}
  forall x.
    rep_(abs_(x))
      =
    x

  forall (m :: Arduino (Expr Bool)).
    rep_ <$> (abs_ <$> m)
      =
    m
\end{verbatim}

A non-rules based version of this pass has also been created, and is
located in ShallowDeepPlugin/RepAbsFusePass.hs
